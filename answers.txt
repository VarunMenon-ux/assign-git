Q. What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project? 
A. gitignore is a text file placed in your git repositories, it tells git to ignore certain files and folders that you don't want included in your master repository. For Java, gitignore should include *.class , *.log, *.ctxt, .mtj.tmp/, *.jar, *.war, *.nar, *.ear, *.zip, *.tar.gz, *.rar, hs_err_pid*, etc.

Q. What does fast-forward in git mean? 
A. In Git, to "fast forward" means to update the HEAD pointer in such a way that its new value is a direct descendant of the prior value. In other words, the prior value is a parent, or grandparent, or grandgrandparent. This keeps all commits created in your feature branch sequential while integrating it neatly back into your main branch.

Q. Why should you have different branches? 
A. Branching allows every developer to branch out from original code and make individual changes to the code without having it affect the main code. Doing so has a lot of benefits. For each feature being worked on by various people, a new branch is created. Once a feature has been tested and developed, it is merged into a common branch. This might be the master branch, but it might also be a development branch used for testing. The development branch is merged into the master branch to signal a version release or a tag after the demo is successful and no additional revisions are needed.

Q. In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have? 
A. Depending on the project, we can have as many git repositories as we want, but can have only one origin. Origin is the default remote created by git when we clone a repository. This way it is possible for us to use multiple remote repositories but a git repository typically has a single named remote repository that points to a hosted version of the code i.e the origin. You can configure a second remote that has two variants, one for push and one for fetch.
